        <h1>IDM 241: Microinteractions Case Study</h1>

          <p><img title="" src="images/image1.png" alt="" /></p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I created a hamburger menu with meaningful
            microinteractions for hover and click actions. When coding the
            project, I completed three stages of builds that had an extra layer
            of complexity each time. The original reference was a feature that I
            had on my personal website that I wanted to improve, and it evolved
            into something more polished and purposeful by the final build.
          </p>
          <h2>Background &amp; Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Microinteractions should be meaningful and add value to the product,
            operating smoothly and seamlessly. It is common UX practice for
            websites to include a hamburger menu that opens up some type of
            overlay. For this project, common design standards were referenced,
            valuing the rule of recognition over recall. Recognition over recall
            states that recognizable UX elements are more successful in
            usability than ones that have to be learned and recalled. In this
            project, the goal was to code a hamburger menu overlay with
            meaningful microinteractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I completed this project solo, so I had agency over the
            decisionmaking, design, and implementation of the code.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The initial design did not feature a hamburger menu overlay.
            Instead, it opened a small module that was difficult to read on all
            screen sizes. There were no animations in the initial product, and I
            wanted to improve the experience with animations
          </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Build a meaningful microinteraction with at least 5 triggers. In
            order for a microinteraction to be meaningful, it should communicate
            feedback to the user so they understand the impact of their actions.
            The actions I included were clicking and hovering, and the
            microinteractions reflected the meaning of each action.
            Additionally, the animations of the microinteractions should be
            smooth to indicate that the state change is intentional and to
            elevate the user experience.
          </p>
          <h2>Building the Microinteraction</h2>
          <p>
            Little by little, the microinteraction was built with layers of
            complexity. The final product was a result of three major
            interaction implementations. By coding the microinteraction in
            stages, I was able to prioritize additions and plan the features in
            three stages.
          </p>
          <h2>Stage 1: Alpha</h2>
          <p>
            The first version of the microinteraction allowed the user to click
            on the menu icon to trigger the overlay, and click the X button to
            close it. I chose this as the first microinteraction because the
            rest of the microinteractions rely on elements within the menu, so
            the priority was ensuring that the user could open and close it.
            After coding this functionality, I began planning the next stages of
            the project. I prioritized adding hover effects next because they
            tell the user which elements are interactive.
          </p>
          <h2>Stage 2: Beta</h2>
          <p>
            The second version of the microinteraction introduced a hover state
            to the elements. In this version, each clickable element scaled up
            in size by 10% and changed color on hover. This layer of the
            microinteraction added clarification to clickable elements and
            offered clues to what may happen when they are clicked on. The
            colors blue and red were used to communicate advancing action or
            regressing action. Clickable items that open a new tab were blue on
            hover, while the icon that closed the module was red on hover.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I coded these elements, one of my priorities was making sure
            that the click and hover areas of the elements were big enough. I
            asked my peers to test my project and I got their feedback about the
            interactive areas. They agreed that the areas were accessible
            because they were large enough, and I felt more confident about the
            accessibility of my design.
          </p>
          <h2>Stage 3: Final</h2>
          <p>
            In the final build, I added a click interaction to the menu
            elements. This stage of the microinteraction was meant to add an
            extra flare of personality to the project, as opposed to previous
            additions that were more focused on usability. When menu items are
            clicked, an underline appears and the background color changes.
            Then, the page loads after a delay. Each menu item has a different
            color background associated with it to differentiate each tab. In
            this stage, I also ensured that each transition was smooth to create
            a seamless and intentional experience.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>

            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The final build is a result of cumulative work and rounds of
            feedback. Throughout the design process, I was able to watch my
            peers&rsquo; progress alongside mine and take notes on what they did
            successfully. Some of my decisions were informed by my peers using
            standard practices. For example, I added the underline on the menu
            item click because of what I learned during class.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I kept the design minimalist to maintain the focus
            on the microinteraction and the experience of using it. If I were
            adding this to a full website, I would ensure that the branding
            matched the site by updating fonts and colors, and possibly adding
            iconography.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The final result is a complex microinteraction built with HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript. It was a great experience to incrementally code a
            project and watch it evolve along the way. I adhered to common
            practices to communicate meaning through microinteractions, and I
            learned about creating interactions to elevate the experience of
            using a product.
